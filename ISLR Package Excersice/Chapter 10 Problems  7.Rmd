## 7. In the chapter, we mentioned the use of correlation-based distance and Euclidean distance as dissimilarity measures for hierarchical clustering. It turns out that these two measures are almost equivalent: if each observation has been centered to have mean zero and standard deviation one, and if we let rij denote the correlation between the ith and jth observations, then the quantity 1âˆ’rij is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance between the ith and jth observations. On the USArrests data, show that this proportionality holds. 

Required packages : ISLR

Answer

Data pulling from ISLR Library 
```{r USArrests}
require(ISLR)
library(ISLR)
attach(USArrests)
```

Proportionality test Euclidean distance vs Correlation distance as mentioned in the question.
```{r prop holds}

phtest<-function(x){
  sx<-scale(x)
  distdat<-dist(sx)
  sqrdistdat<-(distdat)^2
  tsx<-t(sx)
  cor11<-cor(tsx)
  cordata<-as.dist(1-cor11)
  pro<-(sqrdistdat/cordata)
  print(summary(pro))
  par(mfrow=c(1,2),bg="lightyellow")
  plot(pro)
  plot(pro,ylim = c(0,200))
  summary(pro)
  abline(h=3,col="red",lty="dashed")
  abline(h=14,col="green",lty="dashed")
}
paste0(phtest(USArrests))
paste0(phtest(USArrests[1:20,]))
paste0(phtest(USArrests[1:30,]))

```

Insight 1 : As we plotted whole and samples its followed the pattern most of theobervation  falls under green and blue dotted lines with some  noise showing evidence proportionality holds.
